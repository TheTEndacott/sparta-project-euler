## Tasks

* If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.  
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
* By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Tests were written to check the outputs of these tasks.

This was completed in week 9.
